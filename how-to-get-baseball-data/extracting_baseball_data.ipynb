Obviously, there is no shortage of baseball data out there, and different sources contain different types of information you may need. This notebook reviews some of the most common sources, how to extract info from them. \n",

    "- **Pitch characteristics**: velocity, spin rate, movement (horizontal & vertical break)\n",

    "- **Rate limiting**: Baseball Savant may throttle or block requests if you make too many in a short period. The `cache.enable()` call from Section 1 helps avoid repeat downloads. If you get blocked, wait a few minutes and try again.\n",
    "- **Missing values**: Many columns (especially batted ball stats like `launch_speed`, `launch_angle`) are only populated when the ball is put in play. Expect lots of NaN values — this is normal, not a data quality issue.\n",
